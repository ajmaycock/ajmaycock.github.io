<p>This project was created as a gift for my younger brother as he headed off to his first 
year of college. Fortunatley, his new mascot, the tiger, can be built off a standard bear shape.
The stripes however, did take a considerable amount of time to weave in.</p>

<p>I worked off a pattern developed by Anitha of ""A little love everyday"" (https://littleloveeveryday.com/amigurumi-tiger-pattern/),
but ended up with a much larger product due to my choice of a larger yarn and hook. </p>
